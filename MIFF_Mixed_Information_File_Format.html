<h1 class="zword"><a name="1">1 - M.I.F.F.</a></h1>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="1.1">1.1 - Discussion</a></h2>
<p class="zword">What is the purpose of M.I.F.F. (MIFF)?  MIFF is intended to be a simple file format for storing data.  Any data.  And large amounts of data without being too fat.</p>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="1.2">1.2 - Goals</a></h2>
<ul class="zword">
<li class="zword"><strong>Simple</strong>    The format should be simple for the developers to export their data and still be fairly simple to re-import that data.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Brief</strong>     The format should not produce unnecessary waste.  The data in some cases will be quite large so it should not bloat the data too much.  Meaning, file sizes should not become overly large.  However, because of point 1 there will always be some bloat.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Flexible</strong>  The format needs to be able to accomodate change or specific data.  As years go by, software will also change and requirements will change.  The format needs to try its best to keep up without importers and exporters to be completely remade.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Accurate</strong>  The format needs to be able to maintain accuracy of the data.  Namely floating point values.  The in memory value when exported should be reimported without any change.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="1.3">1.3 - Design Decisions:</a></h2>
<p class="zword"><strong>Why not XML or JSON?</strong></p>
<p class="zword">I find XML is too verbose.  JSON is much better than XML and is a reasonable alternative to XML.  Both are very flexible but that can be a double edged sword.  I feel there should be something better.  I do not claim MIFF is better, it is just different.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>Why Big Endian for multibyte data types?</strong></p>
<p class="zword">In the past my company was multi-platform, SGI IRIX, SUN OS, SUN Solaris and Windows (NT/2000/XP/etc.)  At that time the architecture on some of the other platforms was Big Endian and we stored the data in the native format of the machine.  However this lead to issues when users moved their data over to a machine with a different Endian.  The problems that we faced were trivial to solve but were very annoying and yet anothering thing to remember.  So standardizing on one option is easier than having to support two options.  I go with simplicity, only one option to rule them all!  It keeps things simpler even if it does mean a potential performance hit for a platform.  This format is not meant to be good in performance; its main goal is to be good in getting data moved from one place to another.</p>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="1.4">1.4 - Disclosure</a></h2>
<p class="zword">I, Robbert de Groot, have been a professional Software Developer since 1995.</p>
<p class="zword">This format is currently not sanctioned by any software vendor.  This was an attempt on developing something in place of existing or developing options which I find lacking or distasteful in some fashion.</p>
<p class="zword">I can be reached at the following email address.</p>
<p class="zword">zekaric@gmail.com</p>


<h1 class="zword"><a name="2">2 - Format: Base</a></h1>
<p class="zword">A MIFF File is a UTF8 text file where items inside are tab delimited and each record is terminated by a UNIX \n new line.  The contents of the file a collection of key value pairs.  Values are typed.  Nesting is allowed.</p>
<p class="zword">The intent with this format is to make only one read pass over the file.  There is no focus on making the file randomly accessable or modifiable.  This format is not intended as a substitute for native formats for any software package.  This file is meant to be a transfer file format to move data from one program to another.</p>
<p class="zword">Any byte data that is encode or stored as a binary byte sequence will be in big endian order.  In a text file the data is stored in Base64 encoding.</p>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="2.1">2.1 - File Header</a></h2>
<p class="zword">There will always be a file header so that you can be sure the file you recieved is actually a MIFF file and not some other file.  The header is 4 lines long.</p>
<p class="zwordPre">- MIFF[nl]
- 1[nl]
- [Sub-Format Name string][nl]
- [Sub-Format Version string][nl]
</p>
<p class="zword">[tb] means a tab character.  [nl] means a new line character.  The '-' is not part of the line, is it denoting the start of the line.</p>
<ul class="zword">
<li class="zword"><strong>Line 1</strong> - Format of the file.  MIFF.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Line 2</strong> - Version of the file.  Version 1.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Line 4</strong> - Sub-Format name.  A MIFF file is potentially a container for an sub format of the file.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Line 5</strong> - Sub-Format version identifier.</li>
</ul>
<p class="zword">If a sub-format name exists it is not limited to any characters.  A MIFF header is in UTF8 format always.  The only limit to the format name is that it can not be longer than 255 bytes in length and it cannot contain [tb]s or [nl]s.  If there are leading and trailing spaces, then that is part of the format name as silly as that may sound.  Spaces internal to the format name are also allowed and are significant.  I say 255 bytes instead of characters because in UTF8 one character/codepoint can span multiple bytes.  So this name can not exceed this byte count.</p>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="2.2">2.2 - Content</a></h2>
<p class="zword">Before going into the specifics of the format we will cover some things at a high level.</p>

<h3 class="zword"><a name="2.2.1">2.2.1 - Numbers</a></h3>
<p class="zword"><strong>Natural numbers</strong> (unsigned integers for programmers) are whole numbers ranging from 0 to some positive max value.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>Integer numbers</strong> are whole numbers ranging from some negative max value to some positive max value.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>Real numbers</strong>    (floating point numbers for programmers) are positive and negative numbers that may not be whole.  I.E. PI, 3.14159, is a Real number.</p>

<h3 class="zword"><a name="2.2.2">2.2.2 - Record Composition</a></h3>
<p class="zword">A record basically defines a key - value pair.  However the composition of that record is composed of a few parts.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>[key]</strong>              will be a sequence of characters that will somewhat uniquely identify the value.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>[type code]</strong>        will be a sequence of characters that will dictate what the value will look like.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>[array count]</strong>      will be a number or special character to indicate the number of values of a particular type is associated with the key.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>[value]</strong>            will depend on the the above; it will vary in appearance.</p>

<h4 class="zword"><a name="2.2.2.1">2.2.2.1 - Key</a></h4>
<p class="zword">Keys are always a single string of any character in UTF8 encoding as long as none are [tb] and [nl].  Whitespace, leading, trailing, and internal to the key string are significant and cannot be trimmed or thinned out.  Keys are limited to being 255 bytes long.  In UTF8 that may not mean 255 letters/characters as some characters may end up requiring more than 1 byte.  I would suggest to limit the whitespace to just spaces and nothing else.  Everything else should be a printable character.  We do not need another "Whitespace Language" monster.</p>
<p class="zwordPre">12345
;':][.,<>]
a_b_c
$cost
été
This is also a valid key with internal spaces

<h4 class="zword"><a name="2.2.2.4">2.2.2.4 - Value</a></h4>
<p class="zword">See the types respective sections for details.</p>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="2.3">2.3 - Format</a></h2>
<p class="zword">The format is a UTF8 text file.</p>
<p class="zword">The format is only somewhat human readable, and only somewhat text editor friendly.  It was not designed to be "human friendly" but rather "debug friendly."  What I mean is that you will be able to look at the format in a text editor, if that text editor is capable of handling really large files with really long lines; and if you know this format, you will be able to debug it.</p>
<p class="zword">The format does not adhere to any line length limit.  So if you are using a text editor that does have line length limits you may end up corrupting the file or you may not be seeing the whole file.</p>
<p class="zword">All lines are terminated with a single [nl] (\n).  NOT an MSDOS/Windows Cursor Return-New Line pair (\r\n) or a MAC \n\r or just a \r.  This is a strict rule.  If the file has \r\n, \n\r, or \r line endings then it is not a MIFF file.</p>

<h3 class="zword"><a name="2.3.1">2.3.1 - Whitespace Characters</a></h3>
<p class="zword">A whitespace character is any character that does not make a blemish on a piece of paper if printed out; this includes control characters like bell, NULL, form feed, etc.</p>

<h3 class="zword"><a name="2.3.2">2.3.2 - Separator Characters</a></h3>
<p class="zword">MIFF only uses [tb] as a separater character.  And only one [tb] between fields.  Whitespace is not considered a separater character and will be part of a key or value if it is present.</p>

<h3 class="zword"><a name="2.3.3">2.3.3 - Printable Characters</a></h3>
<p class="zword">Just to be clear what a printable character is.  If you had a blank piece of paper with just one character on it, if the character causes ink to be placed on the paper, it is printable.  If it does not make a mark, it is not printable (like spaces, control characters, etc.)</p>

<h3 class="zword"><a name="2.3.4">2.3.4 - Base64</a></h3>
<p class="zword">A few items are stored in Base64.  This is to add a little compression to the items in question but mainly it is to ensure binary exactness of the data when writing the values out and reading the values back in.  Unlike normal Base64 which will break the buffer into lines of a certain length, Base64 values in a MIFF are one long continuous stream of characters.  No \n or line breaks of any kind will be present.</p>

<h3 class="zword"><a name="2.3.5">2.3.5 - Real Number Representation</a></h3>
<p class="zword">All real numbers are stored as a Base64 string.  No exceptions.  This is to ensure that when read back into memory from file, the number is exactly as it was when it was stored in the file.  The real value in the MIFF file will be in Big Endian order.</p>

</p>
<p class="zword">Any space found in the key that is not a [tb] will be part of the key.  They will be significant.  Do not strip or reduce them.</p>
<p class="zword">There has to be one [tb] separator between each part.</p>

<p class="zword">A block is terminated when a value type of "}" is reached.  There is no key for this line value type.  Every begin block value type record requires an end block value type record, there must not be extras of each in the file.  Begin Block record must match with an End Block record.  Do not take a shortcut and omit them even if they are the last few records of the file.</p>

<p class="zword">A single variable type is already an array of mixed values.  And array of variables is not really any different than the single value because the API has no idea what one value would mean.  But this is potentially useful information for a reader.  In other words the reader and writer of a variable type is in control of what goes into the variable type.</p>

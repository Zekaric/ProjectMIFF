<h2 id="11-discussion">1.1. Discussion</h2>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of M.I.F.F. (MIFF)?</strong></p>
<p>MIFF is intended to be a simple file format for storing data.  Any data.  And large amounts of data without being too fat.</p>
<h2 id="12-goals">1.2. Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Simple</strong>    The format should be simple for the developers to export their data and still be fairly simple to re-import that data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brief</strong>     The format should not produce unnecessary waste.  The data in some cases will be quite large so it should not bloat the data too much.  Meaning, file sizes should not become overly large.  However, because of point 1 there will always be some bloat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexible</strong>  The format needs to be able to accomodate change or specific data.  As years go by, software will also change and requirements will change.  The format needs to try its best to keep up without importers and exporters to be completely remade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accurate</strong>  The format needs to be able to maintain accuracy of the data.  Namely floating point values.  The in memory value when exported should be reimported without any change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="13-design-decisions">1.3. Design Decisions:</h2>
<p><strong>Why not XML or JSON?</strong></p>
<p>I find XML is too verbose.</p>
<p>JSON is much better than XML and is a reasonable alternative to XML.  I do have a few issues that I found out with JSON.  JSON format doesn't specify any limits on numbers.  Which is great.  However implementations can do what they like when it comes to numbers they can't handle.  I.E. Javascript change handle 64 bit integers and unsigned integers.  So it tends to write those values out as strings.  The JSON format has no problems but Javascript does.  JSON format doesn't have NAN, Infinity defined for any of the numbers.  So those too are written out as strings and more worryingly, there is no standard on how to write that information out.</p>
<p>Both are very flexible but that can be a double edged sword.  I feel there should be something better.  I do not claim MIFF is better, it is just different.</p>
<p><strong>Why big endian for multibyte data types?</strong></p>
<p>In the past my company was multi-platform, SGI IRIX, SUN OS, SUN Solaris and Windows (NT/2000/XP/etc.)  At that time the architecture on some of the other platforms was big endian and we stored the data in the native format of the machine.  However this lead to issues when users moved their data over to a machine with a different endian.  The problems that we faced were trivial to solve but were very annoying and yet anothering thing to remember.  So standardizing on one option is easier than having to support two options.  I go with simplicity, only one option to rule them all!  It keeps things simpler even if it does mean a potential performance hit for a platform.  This format is not meant to be good in performance; its main goal is to be good in getting data moved from one place to another, accurately.</p>
<h2 id="14-disclosure">1.4. Disclosure</h2>
<p>I, Robbert de Groot, have been a professional Software Developer since 1995.</p>
<p>This format is currently not sanctioned by any software vendor.  This was an attempt on developing something in place of existing or developing options which I find lacking or distasteful in some fashion.</p>

<h1 id="2-format">2. Format</h1>
<p>A <strong>MIFF File is a UTF8 text file</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Each line</strong> in the text file <strong>is a record</strong>.  Each record is <strong>terminated with a</strong> [nl], '\n' <strong>new line character</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A record is a collection of values</strong>.  Each value is <strong>separated by a</strong> [tb], '\t', <strong>tab</strong> character.</p>
<p><strong>A record is</strong> generally <strong>a key-value pair</strong>.</p>
<p>The intent with this format is to make only one read pass over the file.  There is no focus on making the file randomly accessable or modifiable.  This format is not intended as a substitute for native formats for any software package.  This file is meant to be a data transfer file format between software packages or a general format to store data.  It could be used as a native format if desired, just like where JSON is used, but performance will most likely not be better than something more tailor made.</p>
<p>Any data that is encode or stored as a binary byte sequence will be defined by the subformat of the file.</p>
<h2 id="21-file-header">2.1. File Header</h2>
<p>First two records of the file are always the header lines.</p>
<pre><code>MIFF[tb]1[nl]
[value: Sub-Format Name text string][tb][value: Sub-Format Version integer][nl]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Line 1</strong> - Format of the file: text string value &quot;MIFF&quot;, tab, Version of the file: natural value &quot;1&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Line 2</strong> - Sub-Format name: text string value, tab, Sub-Format version: natural value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sub-format name is not limited to any characters.  Text strings are always in UTF8 format.  The only limit to the format name is that it can not be longer than 4096 bytes and it cannot contain raw [tb]s or [nl]s.  Leading spaces are trimmed.  Trailing spaces should not exist but if they do then it is part of the format name.  Spaces internal to the format name are also allowed and are significant.</p>
<p>I say 4096 bytes instead of characters because in UTF8, one UNICODE letter or codepoint can span multiple bytes.  So this name can not exceed this byte count.  These header lines will be encoded like other text values found in the records.  See how a record and record values are encoded.</p>
<h2 id="22-content">2.2. Content</h2>
<p>Each record (a line in the file) is a collection of values.  The first value can be considered a 'key value' for the record.</p>
<p>Each value is separated by a [tb].  The entire line ends in a [nl].  For example...</p>
<pre><code>[value][nl]
[value][tb][value][nl]
[value][tb][value][tb][value]nl]
[value][tb][value][tb][value][tb][value][nl]
...
</code></pre>
<h3 id="221-value">2.2.1. Value</h3>
<p>The sub-format of the file should be dictating what key values follow.  This should be defined somewhere in the documentation of the sub-format.  Like Mining Information MIFF file format.</p>
<p>There can be 0 or more values other than the key value associated with the record.  Again depending on what the sub-format documenation dictates.  Each value will be separated by a [tb].</p>
<p>If there is a count in the line header other than 1, then there should be multiple copies of whatever type that is associated with the key.</p>
<p>Values have a simple format.</p>
<pre><code>[header][valueData]
</code></pre>
<p>The header is a single character.</p>
<p>The valueData will depend on the header.</p>

<p>MIFF file size for simlar data does save quite a few bytes.  Even when compared to JSON and even when compared to JSON in its minimal form.  Zip compression saves over 100 bytes but since this is a made up file and not real world data I don't know if the difference will be significant in the long run.  Uncompressed, MIFF might have an argument over JSON.</p>

<p><strong>Is MIFF better?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I suspect MIFF might have a slight advantage over reading and writing speed over JSON but only slightly.  Probably the difference is not anything to write about.  However MIFF format and parsing is way simpler than JSON.</p>
<p>The header of the file will tell you what the file contains.  JSON has no such thing other than the file name giving you some hint as to what is contained in the file.  OR you structured the JSON to have a small layer to provide a key to the overall object that the file contains.  At least with MIFF, the header tells you it is a MIFF file and what information is store in the file with the subformat header line.  To me this would be important information.  Otherwise, an importer of the data may not know if it is receiving data it is expecting.</p>
<p>JSON doesn't include any size information for arrays or strings.  This leaves it up to the importer to guess how large an array or string should be.  At least with MIFF you can allocate the size before reading.  Nicer for the importer.</p>
<p>JSON doesn't handle numbers quite right.  But this is because JavaScript doesn't handle numbers quite right.  Encoding some special values is not standard.  You can't encode all 64 bit integers or naturals.  Often, for JSON, if a number can't be represented, it is turned into a string.  This adds complication for the importer and exporter of JSON data.  This is where MIFF, I believe, does it right.  At least if all you need is a number that can fit into 64 bit representations (double, int64_t, uint64_t.)  Both formats have issues if you have numbers that are larger than 64 bit types of the C/C++/C#/and similar languages.  However MIFF can be update to handle that.</p>
<p>JSON does array of objects better.  I can't argue that point.  JSON is closer to a programming language in that respect so it naturally does it better.  But this also, in a way, handcuffs JSON as well.  It's not really a data file but a in memory object dump file.  It is great if the data in file matches the in memory representation.  But it is restrictive if you want to deviate from there.</p>
<p>MIFF, I will say, limits how you can write out the file.  It will be fairly predictable while JSON could include a lot of space and formatting or none at all.  I'm not sure which would have the upper hand here but I like MIFF's 1 line 1 record.  Which means, when comparing minimal forms, MIFF's readability is probably more human readable than JSON's minimal form.  But this is just an objective opinion.  MIFF has a advantage that finding differences might be easier for diff programs as MIFF is really only written and appears one way while JSON can vary wildly.</p>
<h2 id="32-comments-on-miff">3.2. Comments on MIFF</h2>
<p><strong>Why not use Base64 for binary data?</strong></p>
<p>I started with base 64.  The problem is that base64 encoding adds a complication.  And in the end, zipping up a similar file with base64 encoded binary data results in a larger zip file.  Or at least with my basic test with the test program.  It seems Hex dumping of binary data results in better data (deflate) compression.  I suspect it is because half byte hex dumping matches the raw byte data more closely and results in a lot more pattern matching; whereas the base64 encoding, which shifts bits around and causes, what appears to be, a little more 'randomness', give compression algorithms a harder time.  Compression algorithms do not like randomness.  Base64 saves in text file size but negatively affects compressed file sizes.</p>
<p>So I figured, why bother with the added complexity of base64.  If you want to save space, compress the file.  Text files are inefficient to begin with.</p>

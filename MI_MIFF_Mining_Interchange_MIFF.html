<h2 class="zword"><a name="1.1">1.1 - Discussion</a></h2>
<p class="zword">What is the purpose of M.I. M.I.F.F. (MI-MIFF)?  MI-MIFF is intended to be a file format for exporting and importing data from one mining software package to another software package.</p>
<p class="zword">I would imagine users of software packages are annoyed at the lack of interoperability between software packages.  Currently each software package attempts to do its best at supporting competitor file formats but there is often a lot of loss of data or, as data formats in each package evolves, suffer from compatibility issues.  Often data needs to be dumped to formats that come 'close' but are not exact, list DXF/DWG, or down to very basic ASCII files, like csv files, which are often lacking compared to the original data.  Users will need to massage this raw data in order to import it into their target software package.</p>
<p class="zword">A lot of the client's time is lost with all this work and often lock them into one system because getting data out or in from that system is too onerous.  The idea with an Information format is to remove some of the pain of this data transfer task and put more of the pain on the software vendors of doing the hard part of reading in the data to their expectations.  The software users will not need to know some of the intricacies of the data or task.</p>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="1.2">1.2 - Goals</a></h2>
<p class="zword">The main goal of this format is to be specifically a data passing format.  It is not intended to be a native format for any software package.  The focus is to make it easy for the developers from any software package to export their data to this format and, without too much difficulty, to import into another vendor's software.</p>
<p class="zword">For the users of the software packages, the process of moving data from package to package will be much easier, less time consuming, less error prone, and less data loss as they will only have to export and import to just one type of file instead of various file formats and requiring more intimate knowledge of the data transfer process specific to their software packages.</p>
<ul class="zword">
<li class="zword"><strong>Simple</strong>, The format should be simple for the developers to export their data.  Import may still be challenging because of the differences between software packages but the format to import the data should not impose too much pain for the developers either.  The simplicity should go a long way in getting the format adopted and implemented.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Inclusive</strong>, All data from all venders should be representable with the least amount of compromises in the data being exported.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Brief</strong>, The format should not produce unnecessary waste.  The data in some cases will be quite large so it should not bloat the data too much.  Meaning, file sizes should not become overly large.  However, because of point 1 there will always be some bloat.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Flexible</strong>, The format needs to be able to accomodate change or account for vendor specific data.  A few software vendors started life in the 70's with time shared machines.  Over the years the amount of data and the types of data the clients want to maintain has changed and grown.  A format needs to try its best to keep up without importers and exporters to be completely remade.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="1.3">1.3 - Disclosure</a></h2>
<p class="zword">As of this writing I, Robbert de Groot, am a Principal Software Developer with Hexagon (previously known as (pka) Hexagon Mining, pka MineSight, pka Mintec Inc.), the current owners of MinePlan 3D software (pka MineSight 3D; pka MEDSystem.); Leica Geosystems, the makers of survey equipment and related material; as well as other mine related hardware and software products.</p>
<p class="zword">This format is currently not sanctioned by any software vendor, including Hexagon.  This was something I am doing as an experiment to satisfy my curiosity.  It was brought about by recent efforts being made by Global Mining Guidelines (GMG), with their Open Mining Format (OMF), which seems to have the backing of some big players in the industry.  My issue with OMF, for now, is that they only have a Python library that implements the format available publically.  The format is strictly binary, which is not entirely a bad idea considering the data that needs to be passed around, but binary formats can be very fussy.  The format is also based on a ZIP archive.  The good thing about ZIP is that it will have excellent compression.  The bad thing is that ZIP archives are, in my opinion, not a great file format.</p>
<p class="zword">So, I thought I would try my hand at defining a format what I think would be good as an Information format.  I am trying to write MIFF independent of any software package.  However there may be some unintended bias as I am most familiar with MinePlan 3D for which I have worked on  since 1995.  I do intend to keep this format as inclusive as possible to address other software  package requirements as best as I understand them.  I know I will make mistakes there because I have only superficial knowledge of most of the competing software in the industry.</p>
<p class="zword">If anyone is interested in educating me on some features they would like to see with respect to their software package of choice I would love to hear from you.  You can reach me at either of the following two email addresses.</p>

<p class="zword"><strong>[projectSystem]</strong> will be a string as defined in a package like GDAL which can translate from one coordinate system to another.  Specifying the system here will mean all coordinate values will be in that system.  Like "WGS84" or "NAD27".  Even the [projectMin] and [projectMax] will be in this system.  Use "local" to indicate that the project coordinates are in a local flat earth space.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>[projectMin]</strong> and <strong>[projectMax]</strong> should given an indication on the data range of the project.  This does not need to be exactly defining the outer limits of the all the data, just the rough range that the data should live inside or around.</p>

<p class="zword">Each item will have a unique <strong>id</strong>.  This id may or may not be provided by the software.  This id is used by the other places in this MI MIFF where this item's values are stored.  Is has to be unique compared to any other items in the item list.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>nameLong</strong> and <strong>nameShort</strong> are two names for this item.  These names may not be unique.  There can be multiple items with the same names but with different ids.</p>

<p class="zword">Drillhole data holds information about drillholes.</p>

<p class="zword">Geometry data holds information that does not fall into Drillhole or Model categories.  This will hold thinks like topography polylines and surfaces.  Stope solids.  Pit cuts etc.</p>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="3.5">3.5 - Model Data</a></h2>
<p class="zword">Some of the information found here is based off of the block model formats that are used at Hexagon, where I work, but also from information found freely on the internet.</p>
<p class="zword"><a href="https://www.deswik.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Block-model-knowledge-for-mining-engineers-An-introduction-1.pdf">Block Model Knowledge For Mining Engineers - An Introduction</a></p>
<p class="zword">There are 3 basic model formats that are in use as Hexagon.</p>
<ul class="zword">
<li class="zword">Block Model</li>
<li class="zword">Seam Model</li>
<li class="zword">Surface Model</li>
</ul>
<p class="zword"><strong>Block Model</strong> is a regular collection of, usually, uniform blocks.  Each block will have values for items that are being tracked by the client.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>Seam Model</strong> is a bit fancier Block Model.  This model is subdivided uniformly in the row and column directions of the model but instead of levels, seams are described.  Each block in a seam will have an elevation top and bottom to indicate the seam's limits, as well as any other values that are found within that seam block just like a normal block model.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>Surface Model</strong> is much more limited than the other two as it just holds a stack of surfaces instead of defining any volume.  This model is subdivided uniformly in the row and column directions of the model but instead of seams you will have a surface.  Each 'block', or really the contact point, for a surface will have an elevation value as well as other values that are being tracked by the client at that surface point.</p>
<p class="zword">Even though only Block Models are sub-blocked, MI-MIFF does not limit you to only allowing sub-blocks for Block Models.  The logic could be applied to the other two types of models.  As far as I know, no software vendors sub-block for Seam or Surface Models.  In general, if you are sub-blocking for these other two cases, you are just going to define a model at the resolution of the sub-block size instead of this two layered approach in my opinion.</p>

<h3 class="zword"><a name="3.5.1">3.5.1 - Model Information</a></h3>
<p class="zword">After the general information block the next block will be the Model Information block.</p>

The length of this vector is the size of the block in the column, row and level directions.  levVec does not need to be sized if the level height is variable.  It should at least be unit length.  All vectors need not be perpendicular to each other but usually this is the case in most software.  I believe there is one software where colVec and rowVec are not 90 degrees to the levVec.  Essentially creating non-square/cuboid blocks.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>blockCount</strong> - The number of column, row, and level blocks.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>isLevVariable</strong> - Flag to indicate the level heights are not uniform.  This does not need to be present if the levels are a fixed height.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>levList</strong> - A list of level heights starting from first level.  Only required if isLevVariable is true.</p>

<p class="zword">In the fixed case of subblocking, as soon as an 's' key is hit, that block is divided into the subblocks as defined in the infoModel section. Use B, b, R, r, C, c, and . in the same way as for the parent blocks.</p>

<p class="zword">In the semi fixed case of subblocking, as soon as an 's' key is hit, that block is divided into the subblocks as defined in the infoModel section.  One difference...</p>
<p class="zword">In this scheme of subblocking, there is an infinite variability in the z direction for each subblock.  This is defined by an 'H' key for the first level of blocks of the subblocks.  The number of level subblocks will depend on how many times H is used for the same column.</p>

<p class="zword">If H or h follows an H or h then the previous block will be holding default values, and the current block will be incremented to the next subblock.  The following H or h will determin the height of the new current block.</p>
<p class="zword">If a subblock cell has already defined the entire height of the block then these will be skipped over when jumping to the next subblock.  This means that some subblock cells could have a different number of levels that others.</p>

<h3 class="zword"><a name="3.6.3">3.6.3 - SubBlock: Octree</a></h3>
<p class="zword">In the octree case, an 's' key will split the block or subblock in to 8 uniform pieces.  If we are already at a subblock then that subblock will be split into small 8 uniform pieces.  This should not exceed the subblock option count defined in the model information block.</p>
<p class="zword">The 's' key need to preceed the v record.</p>

<h3 class="zword"><a name="3.6.4">3.6.4 - SubBlock: Free</a></h3>
<p class="zword">In the free block case, an 's' key will indicate the parent block is subblocked.  However after that you will need to define the blocks manually.</p>

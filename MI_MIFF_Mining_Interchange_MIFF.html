<h1 class="zword"><a name="1">1 - M.I. M.I.F.F.</a></h1>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="1.1">1.1 - Discussion</a></h2>
<p class="zword">What is the purpose of M.I. M.I.F.F. (MI-MIFF)?  MI-MIFF is intended to be a file format for exporting and importing data from one mining software package to another software package.</p>
<p class="zword">I would imagine users of software packages are annoyed at the lack of interoperability between software packages.  Currently some software packages attempt to do their best at supporting competitor file formats (reading only) but there is often a lot of loss of data or, as data formats in each package evolves, suffer from compatibility issues.  Often data needs to be dumped to formats that come 'close' but are not exact, like DXF/DWG, or down to very basic ASCII files, like csv files, which are often lacking compared to the original data.  Users will need to massage this raw data in order to import it into their target software package.</p>
<p class="zword">A lot of the client's time is lost with all this work and often lock them into one system because getting data out or in from that system is too onerous.  The idea with an information format is to remove some of the pain of this data transfer task and put more of the pain on the software vendors of doing the hard part of reading in the data to their expectations.  The software users will not need to know some of the intricacies of the data or task.</p>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="1.2">1.2 - Goals</a></h2>
<p class="zword">The main goal of this format is to be specifically a data passing format.  It is not intended to be a native format for any software package.  The focus is to make it easy for the developers from any software package to export their data to this format and, without too much difficulty, to import into another vendor's software.</p>
<p class="zword">For the users of the software packages, the process of moving data from package to package will be much easier, less time consuming, less error prone, and less data loss as they will only have to export and import to just one type of file instead of various file formats and requiring more intimate knowledge of the data transfer process specific to their software packages.</p>
<ul class="zword">
<li class="zword"><strong>Simple</strong>, The format should be simple for the developers to export their data.  Import may still be challenging because of the differences between software packages but the format to import the data should not impose too much pain for the developers either.  The simplicity should go a long way in getting the format adopted and implemented.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Inclusive</strong>, All data from all venders should be representable with the least amount of compromises in the data being exported.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Brief</strong>, The format should not produce unnecessary waste.  The data in some cases will be quite large so it should not bloat the data too much.  Meaning, file sizes should not become overly large.  However, because of point 1 there will always be some bloat.</li>
<li class="zword"><strong>Flexible</strong>, The format needs to be able to accomodate change or account for vendor specific data.  A few software vendors started life in the 70's with time shared machines.  Over the years the amount of data and the types of data the clients want to maintain has changed and grown.  A format needs to try its best to keep up without importers and exporters to be completely remade.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="zword"><a name="1.3">1.3 - Disclosure</a></h2>
<p class="zword">As of this writing I, Robbert de Groot, am a Principal Software Developer with Hexagon (previously known as (pka) Hexagon Mining, pka MineSight, pka Mintec Inc.), the current owners of MinePlan 3D software (pka MineSight 3D; pka MEDSystem.); Leica Geosystems, the makers of survey equipment and related material; as well as other mine related hardware and software products.</p>
<p class="zword">This format is currently not sanctioned by any software vendor, including Hexagon.  This was something I am doing as an experiment to satisfy my curiosity.  It was brought about by recent efforts being made by Global Mining Guidelines (GMG), with their Open Mining Format (OMF), which seems to have the backing of some big players in the industry.  My issue with OMF, for now, is that they only have a Python library that implements the format available publically.  The format is strictly binary, which is not entirely a bad idea considering the data that needs to be passed around, but binary formats can be very fussy.  The format is also based on a ZIP archive.  The good thing about ZIP is that it will have excellent compression.  The bad thing is that ZIP archives are, in my opinion, not a great file format.</p>
<p class="zword">So, I thought I would try my hand at defining a format what I think would be good as an information format.  I am trying to write MI-MIFF independent of any software package.  However there may be some unintended bias as I am most familiar with MinePlan 3D for which I have worked on  since 1995.  I do intend to keep this format as inclusive as possible to address other software  package requirements as best as I understand them.  I know I will make mistakes there because I have only superficial knowledge of most of the competing software in the industry.</p>
<p class="zword">If anyone is interested in educating me on some features they would like to see with respect to their software package of choice I would love to hear from you.  You can reach me at the following email address.</p>

Use "local" to indicate that the project coordinates are in a local flat earth space.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>[projectMin]</strong> and <strong>[projectMax]</strong> should given an indication on the data range of the project.  This does not need to be exactly defining the outer limits of the all the data, just the rough range that the data should live inside or around.</p>

<p class="zword">Each item will have a unique <strong>id</strong>.  This id may or may not be provided by the software.  This id is used by the other places in this MI-MIFF where this item's values are stored.  It has to be unique compared to any other items in the item list.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>nameLong</strong> and <strong>nameShort</strong> are two names for this item.  These names may not be unique.  There can be multiple items with the same names but need to have different ids.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>type</strong> will define the value being stored for this item.  Type is one of "", r*, n*, i*, date, time, dateTime, enumCode, or formula (formula meaning the item's value is calculated.)</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>min</strong>, <strong>max</strong> define the limits for an item.  Only applicable if item type is a r*, n*, or i*.  If these are missing then the range is the full range as defined by the type.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>precision</strong> is the accuracy of the number.  Only applicable if item type is a r*.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>default</strong> will define the default value for this item if block is skipped.  If this is missing then the default value is 'missing'.</p>
<p class="zword"><strong>calculation</strong> is an equation that is performed to obtain the item's value.  Only applicable if item type is formula.  Use "@[item id]@" in the formula to refer to another item value in the current context.  Full discussion about the formula composition will be discussed elsewhere.</p>
<p class="zword">When precision is used, it will change how the values are stored.  Say we have a min of 0 and an max of 10 and a precision of 0.1.  As a result we have a total of 101 unique values. 0.0, 0.1, ..., 9.9, 10.0.  102 unique values when we include 'missing value' as well.  If this is all the values that need to be recorded then we don't really need to use a full r4 or r8 to store it.  We will be storing instead an n* value such that the n value, multiplied by the precision and added to the min value will recover the r value which is being stored.  In this case, 102 values only requires an n1 to encode all the values in the range.</p>
<p class="zword">If there is an enumeration item value then define the enumeration as a type in the type list and use that type for the item's type.</p>

<p class="zword">An enumeration requires the types defined before the item is defined.  Place the enumeration in the type list.  Note, the enumeration has values 15-Granite, 17-Sandstone, and 19-Shale.  Yet the default for Rock Type item is 0.  This is because it is the index of the value and not the code value.  0 being Granite, 1 being Sandstone, and 2 being Shale in this case.</p>

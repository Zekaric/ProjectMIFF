<h2 class="zdoc"><a name="1.1">1.1 - Discussion</a></h2>
<p class="zdoc">What is the purpose of M.I. M.I.F.F. (MI-MIFF)?  MI-MIFF is intended to be a file format for exporting and importing data from one mining software package to another software package.</p>
<p class="zdoc">Users of software packages are becoming increasingly annoyed at the lack of interoperability between software packages.  Currently each software package attempts to do its best at supporting competitor file formats but there is often a lot of loss of data or, as data formats in each package evolves, suffer from compatibility issues.  Often data needs to be dumped to formats that come 'close' but are not exact or down to very basic, raw ASCII files, like csv files, which are often lacking compared to the original data.  Users will need to massage this raw data in order to import it into their target software package.</p>
<p class="zdoc">A lot of the client's time is lost with all this work.  The idea with an interchange format is to remove some of the pain of this data transfer task and put more of the pain on the software vendors of doing the hard part of reading in the data to their expectations.  The software users will not need to know some of the intricacies of the data or task.</p>

<h2 class="zdoc"><a name="1.2">1.2 - Goals</a></h2>
<p class="zdoc">The main goal of this format is to be specifically an interchange format.  It is not intended to be a native format for any software package.  The focus is to make it easy for the developers from any software package to export their data to this interchange format and, without too much difficulty, to import other vendor's data.</p>
<p class="zdoc">For the users of the software packages, the process of moving data from package to package will be much easier, less time consuming, and less problematic as they will only have to export and import to just one type of file instead of various file formats and requiring more intimate knowledge of the data transfer process specific to their software packages.</p>
<ul class="zdoc">
<li class="zdoc"><strong>Simple</strong>.  The format should be simple for the developers to export their data.  Import may still be challenging because of the differences between software packages but the format to import the data should not impose too much pain for the developers either.  The simplicity should go a long way in getting the format adopted and implemented.</li>
<li class="zdoc"><strong>Inclusive</strong>.  All data from all venders should be representable with the least amount of compromizes in the data being exported.</li>
<li class="zdoc"><strong>Brief</strong>.  The format should not produce unnecessary waste.  The data in some cases will be quite large so it should not bloat the data too much.  Meaning, file sizes should not become overly large.  However, because of point 1 there will always be some bloat.</li>
<li class="zdoc"><strong>Flexible</strong>.  The format needs to be able to accomodate change or vendor specific data.  A few software vendors started life in the 70's with time shared machines.  Over the years the amount of data and the types of data the clients want to maintain has changed and grown.  A format needs to try its best to keep up without importers and exporters to be completely remade.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="zdoc"><a name="1.3">1.3 - Disclosure</a></h2>
<p class="zdoc">As of this writing I, Robbert de Groot, am a Principal Software Developer with Hexagon (previously known as (pka) Hexagon Mining, pka MineSight, pka Mintec Inc.), the current owners of MinePlan 3D software (pka MineSight 3D; pka MEDSystem.); Leica Geosystems, the makers of survey equipment and related material; as well as other mine related hardware and software products.</p>
<p class="zdoc">This format is currently not sanctioned by any software vendor, including Hexagon.  This was something I am doing as an experiment to satisfy my curiosity.  It was brought about by recent efforts being made by Global Mining Guidelines (GMG), with their Open Mining Format (OMF), which seems to have the backing of some big players in the industry.  My issue with OMF, for now, is that they only have a Python library that implements the format available publically.  They may have a specification document somewhere but currently it is not available, or at least I cannot find it anywhere in the 'open'.  Plus this format seems to be strictly binary, which is not entirely a bad idea considering the data that needs to be passed around, but binary formats can be very fussy.  And inspecting their sample OMF file, it does not look like something that is easily reverse engineered.</p>
<p class="zdoc">So, I thought I would try my hand at defining a format what I think would be good as an interchange format.  I am trying to write MIFF independent of any software package.  However there may be some unintended bias as I am most familiar with MinePlan 3D for which I have worked on  since 1995.  I do intend to keep this format as inclusive as possible to address other software  package requirements as best as I understand them.  I know I will make mistakes there because I have only cursory knowledge of most of the competing software in the industry.</p>
<p class="zdoc">If anyone is interested in educating me on some features they would like to see with respect to their software package of choice I would love to hear from you.  You can reach me at either of the following two email addresses.</p>

<h1 class="zdoc"><a name="4">4 - MIFF Format: Mining: Model</a></h1>
<p class="zdoc">Some of the information found here is based off of the block model formats that are used at Hexagon, where I work, but also from information found freely on the internet.</p>
<p class="zdoc"><a href="https://www.deswik.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Block-model-knowledge-for-mining-engineers-An-introduction-1.pdf">Block Model Knowledge For Mining Engineers - An Introduction</a></p>
<p class="zdoc">There are 3 basic model formats that are in use as Hexagon.</p>
<ul class="zdoc">
<li class="zdoc">Block Model</li>
<li class="zdoc">Seam Model</li>
<li class="zdoc">Surface Model</li>
</ul>
<p class="zdoc">Block Model is a regular collection of, usually, uniform blocks.  Each block will have values for items that are being tracked by the client.</p>
<p class="zdoc">Seam Model is a bit fancier Block Model.  This model is subdivided uniformly in the row and column directions of the model but instead of levels, seams are described.  Each block in a seam will have an elevation top and bottom to indicate the seam's limits, as well as any other values that are found within that seam block just like a normal block model.</p>
<p class="zdoc">Surface Model is much more limited than the other two as it just holds a stack of surfaces instead of defining any volume.  This model is subdivided uniformly in the row and column directions of the model but instead of seams you will have a surface.  Each 'block', or really the contact point, for a surface will have an elevation value as well as other values that are being tracked by the client at that surface point.</p>
<p class="zdoc">Even though only Block Models are sub-blocked, Mi-MIFF does not limit you to only allowing sub-blocks for Block Models.  The logic could be applied to the other two types of models.  As far as I know, no software vendors sub-block for Seam or Surface Models.</p>

--------------------   -----------------
model vs               Start of the model data value stream.  Current block is 0 (first) level, 0 (first) row, 0 (column)
B2                     Add 2 to the level index.  Current block jumps to 2, 0, 0.  All blocks on levels 0 and 1 have default values.
R3                     Add 2 to the row index. Curent block jumps to 2, 2, 0.  All blocks on level 2, rows 0 and 1 have default values.
C2                     Add 2 to the column index.  Current block jumps to 2, 2, 2.  Block 2, 2, 0, and Block 2, 2, 1 have default values.
v1.2\n2.3\n3.14\n      Block 2, 2, 2 has values 1.2, 2.3, 3.14.  Current block after this line is 2, 2, 2.
c                      Block 2, 2, 3 get default value.  Current block after this line is 2, 2, 4.
c                      Block 2, 2, 4 get default value.  Current block after this line is 2, 3, 0.  We jumped to the next row
s                      Block 2, 3, 0 is subblocked.  Depending on the subblocking used we start at 0, 0, 0 subblock and used the same B, b, R, r, C, c for
                       navigating the subblock blocks until we reach the subblock block or a '.' key is reacched.  See below for subblock filling.
S                      Similar to s but parent block has values as well as having subblocks with values.  First v encountered is for the parent block.
                       c to jump to the first subblock block.
...
.                      Current block can be anything, this indicates that the rest of the model blocks not yet reached are set to default values.

<p class="zdoc">In the fixed case of subblocking, as soon as an 's' key is hit, that block is divided into the subblocks as defined in the infoModel section. Use B, b, R, r, C, c, and . in the same way as for the parent blocks.</p>

<h3 class="zdoc"><a name="4.2.2">4.2.2 - SubBlock: Semi</a></h3>
<p class="zdoc">In the semi fixed case of subblocking, as soon as an 's' key is hit, that block is divided into the subblocks as defined in the infoModel section.  One difference...</p>
<p class="zdoc">In this scheme of subblocking, there is an infinite variability in the z direction for each subblock.  This is defined by an 'H' key for the first level of blocks of the subblocks.  The number of level subblocks will depend on how many times H is used for the same column.</p>

<p class="zdoc">If H or h follows an H or h then the previous block will be holding default values, and the current block will be incremented to the next subblock.  The following H or h will determin the height of the new current block.</p>
<p class="zdoc">If a subblock cell has already defined the entire height of the block then these will be skipped over when jumping to the next subblock.  This means that some subblock cells could have a different number of levels that others.</p>

<h3 class="zdoc"><a name="4.2.3">4.2.3 - SubBlock: Octree</a></h3>
<p class="zdoc">In the octree case, an 's' key will split the block or subblock in to 8 uniform pieces.  If we are already at a subblock then that subblock will be split into small 8 uniform pieces.  This should not exceed the subblock option count defined in the model information block.</p>

<h3 class="zdoc"><a name="4.2.4">4.2.4 - SubBlock: Free</a></h3>
